A tiny React component to effortless use images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) with tons of possibilities.

You can play with `react-unsplash-wrapper` in a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/5wx6j02034).

## Why?
Because I love Unsplash pics and I wanted to use them in my React prototypes with no effort. For avatars, placeholders or Hero images.

## Installation

```
yarn add react-unsplash-wrapper
```
Or, if you use npm, `npm i --save react-unsplash-wrapper`

## Usage

You only need to import `<Unsplash />` and use it with tons of possibilities:
```jsx
import Unsplash from 'react-unsplash-wrapper'

const Avatar = () => (
  <Unsplash width="64" height="64" keywords="kitten" img />
)

const ImgPlaceholder = () => (
  <Unsplash width="800" height="200">
    Foo bar
  </Unsplash>
)
```

**The easiest way to play with `react-unsplash-wrapper` is with a live example in CodeSandbox, I prepared one for you with lots of examples: [https://codesandbox.io/s/5wx6j02034](https://codesandbox.io/s/5wx6j02034)**

`<Unsplash />` gives you some convenient defaults:

- 1080 x 720 placeholder by default with a random image
- Image as CSS background
- Image covering the container
- Centered content by default (useful for Hero images)
- Minimum height of 400px
- The placeholder expands horizontally
